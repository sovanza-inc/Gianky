# 🎮 Updated Game Flow - 4-Step Process

## Overview
The Gianky game now follows a **4-step sequential flow** that ensures users see their rewards before receiving them in their wallet.

## 🔄 New Game Flow

### **Step 1: User Payment** 💰
- User selects a card to flip
- User pays **5 Gianky tokens** from their wallet to admin wallet
- Transaction is processed on Polygon blockchain
- **Status**: `Processing...`

### **Step 2: Payment Confirmation** ✅
- Wait for blockchain confirmation
- Payment transaction is verified
- User's balance is updated
- **Status**: `Payment Confirmed`

### **Step 3: Reward Reveal** 🎁
- Card automatically flips to reveal the reward
- User sees exactly what they won
- Game state is updated
- **Status**: `Reward Revealed`

### **Step 4: Reward Transfer** 📱
- Admin wallet automatically sends reward to user
- NFT: Minted to user's wallet
- Gianky tokens: Transferred from admin to user
- MATIC: Sent from admin to user
- **Status**: `Reward Transferred`

## 🎯 User Experience

```
Click Card → Pay 5 Gianky → Wait for Confirmation → See Reward → Get in Wallet
```

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### Frontend Changes
- `handleUserPaidPayAndClaim()` - Orchestrates the 4-step flow

- `transferRewardAfterReveal()` - Handles Step 4 (Reward Transfer)
- Separate methods for better error handling

### Backend Integration
- Existing reward endpoints remain unchanged
